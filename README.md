# UD730 - Deep Learning
Repository for [Udacity UD730][1] assignments.

Be sure to create and activate a Python3 [virtualenv][2] (named `tf` in my
case). Then:

Install the latest stable version of [TensorFlow][3] (currently `v0.11.0` in
my case) by following the [installation instructions][4] from their website.

Install other requirements by:

```shell
(tf)$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Have fun!
